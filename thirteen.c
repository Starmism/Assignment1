/*
 * (15 points) A car rental service charges a minimum fee of $25.00 to rent a car for 8 hours,
 * and charges an additional $5 per hour after 8 hours.
 * The maximum charge per day is $50 exclusive of service tax.
 * The company charges an additional $0.50 per hour as service tax.
 * Assume that no car is rented for more than 72 hours at a time.
 * If a car is rented for more than 24 hours, then rental is calculated on a daily basis.
 *
 * Write a program that calculates and prints the rental charges for
 * each of three customers who rented cars from this agency yesterday.
 * You should enter the hours for which the car has been rented for each customer.
 * Your program should print the results in a neat tabular format and should calculate
 * and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts.
 * The program should use the function calculateCharges to determine the charges for each customer.
 * Your outputs should appear in the following format:
 *      Car     Hours    Charge
 *      1       12       56.00
 *      2       34       117.00
 *      3       48       124.00
 *      TOTAL   94       297.00
